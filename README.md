# Obytify

Obytify your social media account with a tool that puts your avatar in the big O.

## Tech
This tool uses customized SVG of O<sub>byte</sub> logo on HTML5 Canvas and FileReader JavaScript API to let users upload their avatar without the need to store or proccess anything on back-end, so this tool can be hosted on static HTML hosting, like Github.io.
